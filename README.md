<h2>Description</h2>
<hr>
<p>We get it. You're bored.</p>
<p>There's only so many times you can rewatch
Homecoming or Love is Blind or whatever while you're
working, living, and connecting remotely.</p>
<p>The Quarantine Media Reccomender (QMR) can help.
You type in your topic of interest and the QMR delivers a
list of books, movies, or songs to explore while you're
waiting for your groceries to get delivered.</p>
<p>There's also a handy review section that stores your
reviews and ratings so you can remember what you
thought when you watched Tiger King the first time.</p>
